I used word2vec model to do text classification by measuring the similarity score between the post and the dictionary I constructed for each pre-defined category. Measuring the similarity between the post and the full dictionary of a speciﬁc category, the algorithm would generate similarity scores on each category for each post. After obtaining all these similarity scores, I classiﬁed posts based on which category got the highest similarity score.
